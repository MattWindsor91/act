# `toplevel`: `act` toplevel

The top-level parts of `act` (excluding the actual entry point and
regression test suites) live here, including:

- the sub-command implementations;
- glue code to connect the top-level to the language and compiler
  specific modules.

Most of the interesting parts of `act` live elsewhere.
