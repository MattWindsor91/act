# `fuzz`: the ACT fuzzer

This library contains the implementation of ACT's _fuzzer_: a set of processes
for converting straight-line C litmus tests (such as those generated by
Memalloy) into hideously complicated C litmus tests (with the intention of
fooling compilers into introducing concurrency bugs).
