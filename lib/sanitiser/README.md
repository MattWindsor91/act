# `lib`: target-independent, mid-level parts of `act`

This part of `act` contains the majority of `act`'s language and
compiler-independent code.  It also contains interfaces and utilities used
by the target-specific parts.

This module is gradually being phased out in favour of more specific
top-level modules.
