# Configuration modules

This top-level module contains the configuration interface for `act`.

Most of the top-level configuration lives in, or is referenced from,
the `Config.Act` module.  This is configuration that is common to
practically every use case of `act`, and generally comes from the
`act.conf` file (modified along the way by command-line arguments).
