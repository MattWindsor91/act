This module contains `act`-specific plumbing used in too many places to

- For more general helper functions and signatures, see `Utils`.
- For functions and signatures relating to file I/O and structuring
  programs that deal with it, see `Plumbing`.
- For more high-level bits of `act`, see the various other libraries.
