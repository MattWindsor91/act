(** Mini-model: variable typing environments

    Large parts of the mini-model's type checking and program fragment
   generation functionality depends on the existence of a typing
   environment mapping variable names to their {{!Mini_type}mini-model
   types}.  This module, and its accompanying {{!Mini_env_intf}intf
   module}, provide a modular interface for these typing environments.

    Usually, the typing environments will be built as first-class
   modules, generated by applying {{!Make}Make} to a lifted map
   value. *)
