flow.if.duplicate:
  Weight: 1x
  Summary:
    Removes a sublist of statements from the program, replacing them with an
    `if` statement containing some transformation of the removed
    statements.
    
    This version of the action generates an arbitrary condition, and
    initialises both branches of the `if` statement with the original
    statements.
program.make.empty:
  Weight: 1x
  Summary:
    Generates a new, empty program at one end of the program list. This
    action isn't very useful on its own, but works well in combination with
    other actions that construct statements and control flows.
store.make.int.single:
  Weight: 3x
  Summary:
    Generates a store operation on a randomly selected fuzzer-generated
    global variable.
    
    This operation generates 'atomic_int's.
    
    This version of the action only stores to variables that haven't
    previously been selected for store actions. This makes calculating
    candidate executions easier, but limits the degree of entropy somewhat.
var.make.global:
  Weight: 2x
  Summary:
    Generates a new global variable, with a random name, initial value, and
    primitive type.
