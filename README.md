# act: automagic compiler tormentor

`act` is a work-in-progress automatic compiler tester for finding
concurrency memory model discrepancies between C code and its
compiled assembly.  It uses
[memalloy](https://github.com/JohnWickerson/memalloy) as a test-case
generator, and will eventually generate litmus tests that can be
used with herd7.

Parts of `act` derive from the
[herdtools7](https://github.com/herd/herdtools7) project of Alglave,
Maranget, et al.

## What it can do (so far)

- Run various versions of x86-32 gcc/clang against a set of memalloy
  witnesses (including experimental compile-by-SSH support);
- Sanitise the assembly output by removing or simplifying pieces of
  syntax that herd7 doesn't understand (though this process is
  inherently partial and prone to issues);
- Generate litmus tests from the sanitised assembly;
- Run herd on those litmus tests, saving the results for later
  inspection.
- Other modes allow per-file sanitisation, litmus generation,
  Herd running, etc.

Future versions of `act` will automate the comparison of herd output
against the memalloy input, and support more
compilers/architectures/dialects/instructions/syntax.

## Building and running

`act` uses the `dune` build system.  The practical upshot of this is
that, so long as you run `act` through `dune exec`, `dune` will
automatically build `act` for you when needed.

### Supported operating systems

`act` uses Jane Street's `core` library, which only works properly on
POSIX-style operating systems.  If you're using Windows, consider
using WSL, or Cygwin, etc.

We've tested `act` on:

- macOS (x86-64)
- Debian buster (x86-64): note: this is tested fairly infrequently, so
  there may be regressions compared to macOS

### Requirements

First, you'll need:

- OCaml (4.07+)
- opam (tested with version 2)
- dune (1.4+)

You'll then need to install several `opam` packages.  To find out which,
run `dune external-lib-deps --missing bin/main.exe`.

**NOTE**: For `menhirLib`, install the `menhir` OPAM package (not the
nonexistent `menhirLib` one!).

### Preparation

First, copy `compiler.spec.example` somewhere (by default, `act` looks
for it in `./compiler.spec`), and adjust to your needs.

### Running

The easiest way to run `act` is through `dune exec bin/main.exe --
ARGS`; this will build `act` if needed.  Use `dune exec bin/main.exe
-- help` for general usage.  (The `--` is needed to stop `dune` from
trying to parse the arguments itself.)

### Testing

`dune runtest` will run `act`'s _expects_ tests, and output any
discrepancies in `act`'s output as diffs.

## How to use `act`

`act` has several different modes:

- `litmusify`: converting a single assembly file to a litmus test, and
  optionally sending it to Herd;
- `explain`: asking `act` to explain every line in an assembly file
  from its perspective;
- `memalloy`: running `act` on every example generated by a run of
  `memalloy`.

### Converting a single assembly file to a litmus test

`dune exec bin/main.exe litmusify COMPILER-NAME path/to/asm.s`

This asks `act` to try to convert the given assembly file into a
Litmus test, using the spec for compiler `COMPILER-NAME` to tell it
things about the flavour of assembly incoming.  By default, the litmus
test is printed on stdout: use `-o FILE` to override.

**NOTE**:
Since `act` won't have any information besides that inside the
assembly file, the litmus output won't have any postconditions or
initial assignments, and `act` will make incomplete guesses about
where program boundaries and interesting memory locations are.

### Analysing an assembly file without conversion

`dune exec bin/main.exe explain COMPILER-NAME path/to/asm.s`

This asks `act` to dump out the given assembly file along with
line-by-line annotations explaining how `act` categorised each line of
assembly.  This is mostly useful for debugging what `act` is doing.

### Processing a memalloy run

`dune exec bin/main.exe memalloy path/to/memalloy/results`

This asks `act` to run the compilers listed in `./compiler.spec` on
the witnesses in `path/to/memalloy/run/C`, then convert them into
litmus tests in the same way that `litmusify` would.

By default, `act` will dump its results in directories in the current
working directory.
