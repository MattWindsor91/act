Welcome to the ACT documentation
================================

*Automagic Compiler Tormentor*, or ``act``, is a project for setting
up C compiler concurrency tests.

This documentation covers how to use ``act`` and its various
components.  It *doesn't* cover:

- how to build ``act`` (see the project `README`_);
- the ``act`` API (see the auto-generated `odoc`_ documentation);
- any of the academic theory behind ``act`` (there'll be a paper on it eventually).

.. warning:: This documentation is a heavy work-in progress, and is very incomplete.
   Check back frequently for updates.
