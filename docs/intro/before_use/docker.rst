Using the ACT Docker image
==========================

ACT has an experimental Docker image available on Docker Hub, using the
repository `captainhayashi/act`_.

This Docker image contains a Debian *stable* install with:

- an unprivileged user ``act``;
- Memalloy installed at ``/home/act/memalloy``;
- the ACT and Herdtools7 binaries installed at ``/home/act/bin``;
- the ACT scripts installed at ``/home/act/scripts``;
- both GCC and Clang installed;
- an autogenerated, ready-to-use ACT configuration at ``/home/act/act.conf``.

The image is set up such that the test recipes discussed in
`intro-test` should 'just work'.
