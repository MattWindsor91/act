Scripts

ACT comes with a directory of shell scripts, ``awk`` files, and
other pieces of plumbing to help set up testing workflows.  These
live in the ``./scripts`` directory.

.. warning:: Under construction.

.. note::

   Most of ACT's scripts assume that the current directory is the
   ACT project root (in other words, that the scripts are in ``./scripts``).
   This may be fixed eventually.
