# Unreleased

- Replaced the S-expression `compiler.spec` format with a more human-friendly,
  act-specific one.  See `bin/act.conf` for an example of the syntax, which is
  similar to OpenBSD's utility config format.
- Renamed `compiler.spec` to `act.conf` -- this should help users spot the
  change in format, as well as being more indicative of what the file is.
- Changelog starts here.

This changelog started on 2018-12-19, and doesn't contain any changes made
prior to that date.
