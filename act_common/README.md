# `Act_common`: common infrastructure used in `act`

This module contains `act`-specific plumbing used in too many places to
belong in a specific module.

- For more general helper functions and signatures, see `Utils`.
- For more high-level bits of `act`, see `Lib` (being phased out) or
  the various other modules.
