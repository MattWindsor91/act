# Example memalloy output

This directory contains the pre-processed, DNF-converted results of running
Memalloy on the PartialSC C model.

##Â What's the difference between this and the other example directory?

The other directory was produced against the RC11 model of Lahav et al., which
flags as invalid certain executions that are permitted by both PartialSC and
certain ISA memory models.
